# SLE-RBODI

## Description 
The repository contains R code need for derivation of Register-Based Organ Damage Index (RBODI; Gomez et al. 2025) to assess organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on national register data.

## Details
RBODI was developed and evaluated by Gomez et al. in 2025 based on a linkage of Swedish national registers. The R script for derivation of RBODI has been restructured during 2025 to improve generalizability and readibility and is made available as part of publication of a study by Dominicus et al. XXXX.
